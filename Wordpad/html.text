    <p>I am currently an Undergraduate student of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Batangas State University. 
        I was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I learned everything I needed to know there. Everything that has to do with life that is. I started my education there and I will continue it where ever I go. My educational background was just as normal and fun like any other kids. But I was the unique child that made my education different and more enjoyable. My learning process has five processes: elementary, middle, high school, college, and the future.
        The teachers taught me well, while my peers taught me more about life. I made my best friends in middle school and we are a family now. I cherished the time I spent in middle school. I was a top student who was doing well, had many friends, and was making a name for myself in sports and extracurricular activities. Then once again graduation rolled around and I had to leave all of the good things behind. But I was ready to embark on an education that was more geared towards my future.
